Abstract

The relationship between visual loss and psychosis is complex: congenital visual loss appears to be protective against the development of a psychotic disorder, particularly schizophrenia. In later life, however, visual deprivation or visual loss can give rise to hallucinosis, disorders of visual insight such as blindsight or Anton syndrome, or in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, more complex psychotic presentations. 




*Bayesian Brain*
The "Bayesian Brain" Model aims to understand and explicate the complex processes underlying perception, decision-making and learning, three fundamental areas of cognition. The Bayesian Brain Theory, a computational approach derived from the principles of Predictive Processing (PP), offers a mechanistic and mathematical formulation of these cognitive processes. This theory assumes that the brain encodes beliefs (probabilistic states) to generate predictions about sensory input, then uses prediction errors to update its beliefs. 

_Altered Conscious Vision, Reality and Psychosis
The focus has been on the role of precision as encoding uncertainty in hierarchical predictive coding--and how this is affected by early visual experience. The explanatory scope of this formulation is appealing due to the notion that it links neurodevelopment with Bayesian belief updating and the opportunity for false inference -- of the sort associated with positive psychotic symptoms (i.e. positive symptoms are those that add or distort the person's normal functioning; this includes delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech -- whereas negative psychotic symptoms include restricted emotional and facial expression as well as restricted speech and verbal fluency). 

A key aspect of this formulation is that it rests upon the top-down control of precision at various levels of the cortical hierarchy. In turn, this means the brain must be equipped with predictions or beliefs about precision, namely, beliefs about beliefs.

Figure 01. Summary model. The correlation of spontaneous signals between cortical visual areas is influenced by both shared input signals and intrinsic neural activity. Blindness reduces shared, between-hemisphere input to visual areas, from both retinal and higher cortical sources. The signals intrinsic to hierarchical, connected visual areas therefore constitute a greater proportion of spontaneous neural activity, enhancing the relative strength of hierarchical correlation measures as compared to indirect. Congenital blindness has the additional effect of broadening between-visual-area axonal arborization and thus measured cortico-cortico receptive fields.

 


 This is important because it speaks to a form of metacognition, namely, beliefs about the precision of beliefs lower in the hierarchy, or “hyperpriors.” One example is “large amplitude prediction errors can only be generated by things I can’t predict” (such as external agents); such a hyperprior may give rise to erroneous external attributions of the causes of sense data in psychosis. Thus, hyperpriors in the hierarchies of developmentally typical individuals predispose to visual hallucinations following visual deprivation or later-life visual loss. With congenital visual loss, however, by virtue of developing within an inherently less predictable world, different hyperpriors obtain that are less likely to garner external attributions and psychosis. (There is resonance here with the autism literature also, in which aberrant precision of prediction errors likewise perturbs difficult social inferences.72) On this view, the role of hyperpriors (about precision) may also inform the extent to which people have an insight into their false percepts. In the neuropsychology of vision, there are patients whose brain damage and subsequent dysfunction help us think about vision and consciousness. Blindsight describes the covert visual abilities of brain damaged individuals who deny conscious visual perception. It is contrasted with Anton’s syndrome, wherein blind individuals claim to be sighted and behave as though they are (walking through, but colliding with, objects in the world). Both of these syndromes are characterized by acquired damage to the visual cortex in individuals whose development (and interaction with the visual world) was otherwise typical. The syndromes are consistent with a Bayesian Prediction Error Minimization Model of conscious perception, wherein candidate percepts are predicted and to some extent visual experience is consistent with those model predictions. The syndromes differ in the richness with which those predictions are experienced. Blindsight has low richness which conflicts with behavioral detection of stimuli. Anton’s has high richness that conflicts with reality.

**It is suggested that in blindsight, model predictions and the extent to which perception conforms to predictions are impaired. In Anton's Syndrome, prediction error minimization is impaired such that individuals fail to infer that they are indeed blind. In Charles-Bonnet syndrome, model making and perception aligning with ones’ model is hyper-engaged, however, and prediction error processing, particularly at higher hierarchical levels (which we may term reality monitoring) is somewhat intact, since Charles-Bonnet syndrome cases often appreciate that they are hallucinating
